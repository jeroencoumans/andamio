<div class="box-content">
    <p>A pattern to make a whole block clickable by adding an (empty) anchor which is displayed over the content. Optionally, you can add actions with their own link. </p>
    <p class="alert">NOTE: this pattern shouldn't be used on mobile, since it uses <code>position:relative</code> and will cause rendering bugs on iOS. It's probably better there to use a link around anything that you want to be clickable. </p>

    <div class="click-block">
        <a href="#click-block-link" class="click-block-link"></a>
        <div class="click-block-content">Content that is clickable</div>
        <a href="#click-block-action" class="button click-block-action">Button with its own link</a>
    </a>
