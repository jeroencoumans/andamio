<div class="box">
    <p>By default, Andamio comes with support of three default views. Each view has its own header and scrollable content area. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Parent view</dt>
        <dd>This is the default view you see when opening Andamio. It's main purpose is to show the user the primary actions, e.g. a list of articles. </dd>

        <dt>Child view</dt>
        <dd>This view will slide in from the right. It's meant to show a full view of the whatever item the user clicks on in the overview list, e.g. a full article. </dd>

        <dt>Modal view</dt>
        <dd>This view will slide up from the bottom. It's main purpose is to present the user a set of secondary actions or content, e.g. preferences or help text.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The content of a view is setup as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-markup" data-src="boilerplate/view-content.html"></pre>

    <p>Be sure to include all the classes as shown to allow Andamio to do its magic. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>.page-header</dt>
        <dd>This contains the view's header bar at the top. By default it's fixed so it won't scroll. </dd>
        <dt>.page-logo</dt>
        <dd>Here you can put in the title of the view, or a logo. It's configured at a maximum width of 140px (configurable in your main.less).</dd>
        <dt>.js-title</dt>
        <dd>This class allows actions to set the title of the view they're opening. Feel free to leave it out if you're using a fixed logo that should be placed on each view.</dd>
        <dt>.button-header-wrapper</dt>
        <dd>This class will create a wrapper for a button on the left side of the page header. Make sure to also include the <code>.button-header</code> element! The wrapper is used for positioning and the action, while the inner element is used for styling. It's setup this way to allow a bigger click target.</dd>
        <dt>.button-header-wrapper-alternate</dt>
        <dd>Same as <code>.button-header-wrapper</code>, except for creating a button on the right side of the page header. </dd>
        <dt>.page-content</dt>
        <dd>This holds the scrollable content and is positioned under the header. It will fill up the remaining space.</dd>
        <dt>.js-content</dt>
        <dd>This is how actions know where to put the content; by default it goes to the page-content, but in some cases you may put this somewhere else. </dd>
        <dt>.overthrow</dt>
        <dd>This makes sure the content is scrollable. </dd>
    </dl>
